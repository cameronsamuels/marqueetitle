MarqueeTitle is a JavaScript library that lets you easily make your website's tab title into scrolling text.

This lets users be able to read the entire web page's tab title, while also catching their eye and amazement. Your website will stand out to your customers.

MarqueeTitle is very easy to use and only takes a few minutes to set up. Plus, it won't affect your website's performance as it's very light-weight.

You can intuitively customize your setup with chosen repeat division text and scrolling speeds.

## Getting started
Download [marquee.js](https://git.io/vpBc9) to the website's files.
Edit the last few lines of the file to fit the website's needs.
Then use this code to add the script to the website:

```html
<script src="marquee.js"></script>
```
